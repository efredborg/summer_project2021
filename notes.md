# Coronal bright spots

Was initially discovered with X-ray to be point-like structures (XBP) with diameter of 20'' - 30'' and bright cores of 5'' - 10'' that is surrounded by diffuse emission. The XBPs were associated with small regions of opposite polarity magnetic flux which doubtlessly suggested that these phenomena are "the X-ray manifestation of low lying closed bipolar magnetic structures outside active regions". High resolution monochromatic spectroheliograms revealed that the bright points consisted of rapidly and independently evolving 2-3 small-scale loops with a diameter of~2500km and length of 12 500km. Studying the evolution of CBPs in X-rays revealed that diffuse emission always precedes the bright core that vanishes before the final disappearance of the XBP. 

- Core often was elliptical in shape. 
- CBPs had rapid growth and slow decay (from intensity evolution).
- Similar growth rate suggests strong relation to the  supergranular evolution or/and supergranular flows.
- Indication that CBPs are independent of the overlying corona, i.e. the specific magnetic topology of the observed region. 
- Emission peaks were not co-spatial, suggesting that the CBPs are composed of complex loops at different temperatures. 

### Magnetic field

- CBPs have been found to overlay small-scale bipolar magnetic flux concentrations. 
- Emerging bipolar regions (ER) side ~40'' have an average lifetime of less than a day and appear bright in H$\alpha$.
- All XBPs were associated with bipolar magnetic features except very newly emerged or old and decaying XBPs. 
- Only  49% of ERs were found to be linked to XBPs. A large part of the remaining ERs were associated with diffuse X-ray brightenings overlaid by large coronal structures that possibly prevent the identification of these brightenings as CBPs. 



### Important points

- CBPs are composed of small-scale loops with hotter loops overlaying
cooler connecting opposite magnetic flux concentrations found in the network at the
junctions of supergranulation cells. CBP loops evolve rapidly at time scales as short
as 5 min.
- The number of CBPs outside the active region belt are found to
remain relatively constant during the solar cycle. Background emission variation was
established as the main cause for the solar cycle anti-correlation usually observed.
The CBP number in AR latitudes is found to change with the solar cycle suggesting
a relation to ephemeral regions in the AR belt.
- CBPs are associated with photospheric flux of opposite polarities
called magnetic bipoles/dipoles. In some cases the photospheric field is more complex
than a simple bipole resulting in complicated loop connectivities as seen in coronal
imaging channels.
- While the upper boundary of the magnetic flux is believed to
be âˆ¼ $10^20$ Mx, it remains an open question what the minimum magnetic flux required
to produce a small-scale loop with enhanced coronal emission (a hot loop) is.
