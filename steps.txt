Steps in iris2 inversion

 - Load Mg II h&k line data
 - Crop the wavelength to a common observed wavelength
 - Mask to remove any pixels with the DNs below 0 or with NaN values
 - The data are calibrated and reduced from 3D to 2D (x*y, lambda)
 - Inverted RPs are interpolated to the observed wavelengths
 - Iris2 looks for closes RP determined by the chi^2
 - The RMA corresponding to the RP found by iris2 is assigned to the pixel where the observed profile is located
 - Using PCA decomposition of the observed profiles in PCA space accelerates inversion.
 - Output is a iris level 2 raster file ('iris2model'), contains atmosphere model and uncertainties.
